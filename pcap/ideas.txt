shamelessly stolen from nasa ctf write up

you are given a network traffic capture and asked to determine the attacker’s listening post, which is the attacker’s server. 

The pcap shows only 2 IPs, 10.130.171.154 and 172.18.105.113.

the question says LISTENING server, so the question really is looking at the pcap, who is initating, and who is listening.
